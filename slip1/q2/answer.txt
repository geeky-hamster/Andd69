2. Configure Android Development Tools (ADT) Plug-in and Create Android Virtual Device

**Step 1: Configure Android Development Tools (ADT) Plug-in**
- The ADT plug-in was used with Eclipse IDE for Android development. However, modern Android development uses Android Studio, which has all necessary tools integrated.
- If using Eclipse (legacy):
  - Go to Help > Install New Software.
  - Add the ADT plug-in URL: https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/
  - Select 'Developer Tools' and follow the prompts to install.
  - Restart Eclipse after installation.
- In Android Studio, ADT functionality is built-in, so no separate installation is required.

**Step 2: Create Android Virtual Device (AVD)**
- Open Android Studio.
- Go to Tools > Device Manager (or AVD Manager).
- Click 'Create Device'.
- Select a hardware profile (e.g., Pixel 4) and click 'Next'.
- Choose a system image (e.g., Android 12.0) and click 'Next'.
- Configure AVD settings as needed and click 'Finish'.
- The new virtual device will appear in the Device Manager. You can start it by clicking the 'Play' button.

This process allows you to emulate Android devices for testing your applications without needing a physical device.
