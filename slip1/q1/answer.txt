1. Install / Configure Java Development Kit (JDK), Android Studio and Android SDK

To begin Android development, you need to set up the Java Development Kit (JDK), Android Studio, and the Android Software Development Kit (SDK). Here are the steps:

**Step 1: Install Java Development Kit (JDK)**
- Download the latest JDK from the official Oracle website (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
- Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
- Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable:
  - Right-click on 'This PC' > Properties > Advanced system settings > Environment Variables.
  - Under System Variables, click 'New', enter `JAVA_HOME` as the variable name and the JDK installation path as the value.
  - Add `%JAVA_HOME%\bin` to the 'Path' variable.
- Verify installation by running `java -version` in the command prompt.

**Step 2: Install Android Studio**
- Download Android Studio from https://developer.android.com/studio.
- Run the installer and follow the setup wizard. It will guide you through installing Android Studio, the Android SDK, and the Android Virtual Device (AVD) manager.
- Launch Android Studio after installation.

**Step 3: Install Android SDK**
- During Android Studio setup, the SDK is usually installed automatically.
- To verify or install additional SDKs, open Android Studio > Tools > SDK Manager.
- Select the required SDK platforms and tools, then click 'Apply' to download and install them.

With these steps, your system will be ready for Android development.
